This plugin to Microsoft Office was introduced in version 2.x of Alfresco, and was officially maintained and supported by Alfresco.

With the introduction of SharePoint Protocol support in version 3.2, development on this stopped, though bugs continued to be fixed and the plugin continued to be supported.

With the release of Alfresco 4.0, Alfresco stopped officially supporting this plugin, and donated the code to this community project.
