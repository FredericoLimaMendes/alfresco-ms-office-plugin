The MS Office plugin provides an integration with Alfresco that is independent of the SharePoint Protocol.

The plugin provides access to:
  * Checkout / checkin
  * Tasks
  * Browse
  * Search
  * Metadata
  * Tags

SharePoint protocol support was integrated into Microsoft Office in version 2007, and is the standard way of integrating Alfresco and MS Office.

This plugin is useful for earlier versions of Office (2003 and XP) and use cases that are not well supported by the SharePoint protocol. The plugin does not currently integrate with the Alfresco Share interface, but instead uses the older Alfresco Explorer interface.

The plugin was confirmed to work with Alfresco 3.4 and MS Office 2003 and 2007. Downloads for Alfresco versions 3.4 and earlier are available with the official Alfresco binaries.

**This project is not officially supported by Alfresco.**
